            Security of the Baltic Sea Region
        </h1>
        <p><i>The name of the Baltic Sea region does not only refer to geography – for centuries it has been
                facilitating
                flows of
                ideas, goods and people. Serving as an important uniting factor, it has also been an endless source of
                protracted
                conflicts and wars. In the ambiance of a strategic contest between the West and Russia, the security of
                the
                Baltic
                Sea
                region seems to be very fragile today – even more at risk than ever before. To decrease the tension we
                should define
                the
                biggest challenges that the main actors in the region face today. So, what are they for Germany, Poland
                and
                Russia?</i></p>

        <h2>Long Haul Through Decennaries</h2>
        <p>Today, Russian-Western relations are in the most dramatic crisis and the impact of these problems is
            especially
            obvious
            in the Baltic Sea region (BSR). From the security point of view, the BSR is very important and recently
            seemed
            to be one
            of the most promising areas for cooperation of the West with Russia. Unfortunately, we see what we see –
            in 2019
            it is
            one of the most risky and dangerous regions in Europe. At the same time, the history of this complex and
            sensitive
            region does not let forget the past contradictions and only exacerbates the current confrontation.</p>
        <p>After 2014 it became obvious that all the attempts to develop a common security structure over the past
            20 years
            have
            largely failed. It refers not only to unsuccessful tries to bind Russia but also to multiple tryings to
            provide
            regional
            security focusing on security-related institutions. The recent case of Crimea has led to the reassessment
            of NATO
            collective defense arrangements. While since 1991 the status quo was maintained, later it became
            clear
            that
            certain political actions can rapidly lead to military conflict. A difficult
            partnership
            became an outright confrontation.</p>
        <h2>Inevitable Conflict</h2>
        <p>BSR, being the “eastern flank” of NATO today, is an interdependent coalescence of eight Nordic and Baltic
            states.
            Despite their steady growth and successful cooperation, they are quite vulnerable, as the
            region is
            a key
            area both for Russia and the West: it is a buffer zone and a probable war theatre, where on Gotland
            or the
            Aland
            Islands an offensive operation could possibly start.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, countries take completely different stances in their viewpoints on the problem of BSR. In
            Russia’s
            opinion, the spread of Western institutions along its borders is an
            existential hazard. Meanwhile, Western counties see it as the expansion of the rule-based international
            order.
            This
            contradiction is obvious not only in BSR – the dissimilar interpretation of globalization and democracy
            provokes
            a clash
            of interests even far from the Baltic Sea. But today their misunderstanding can lead not merely to a
            moderate
            response
            as it was the foundation of post-Cold War order but to devastating consequences of military conflict.
        </p>

        <h2>Time for Recriminations</h2>
        <p>The tension in the region has already increased and the risks to stability are visible. They will
            unlikely take
            the form
            of an open military conflict but risks will definitely have direct and indirect impacts on its future.
            Both
            sides blame
            each other for this situation – Russia perceives itself as a target of Western aggression while the West
            accuses
            Russia
            of military interventions. Also, Russia, Germany and Poland have different opinions about NATO and EU
            enlargement in the
            region. Russia sees the region as a field for competition for power and NATO sees “deterring Russia” as
            a reason
            for
            development in the region. The region today is in grey zone between war and peace – thanks to military
            exercises
            and
            hybrid hazards, that became asymmetrical.</p>
        <p>Besides, the impact of the US on the trilateral relations between Germany, Poland and Russia, like the
            recent
            opening of
            the military base ‘Fort Trump” in Poland, can only boost Russian mistrust to allies, when they engage on talks about
            mutual
            confidence. In fact, the attempts of the allies to promote regional stability are also torpedoed by the
            lack of
            political consensus on NATO membership – when Poland accuses Germany of spending much less GDP for
            defense than
            required, it does not rise the interest of other countries in deeper integration. What is more, Finland
            and
            Sweden are
            still not covered by NATO defense clause – it is one more destabilizing factor that makes the situation
            more
            erratic.</p>

        <h2>Light at End of Tunnel</h2>
        <p>However, the prospects are not as negative as it may look: a number of challenges should be overcome
            but
            there are a
            number of issues that can be implemented in the near future. Definitely, the process of implementation
            can be
            started
            with deepening of cooperation in topics of common interest: investments into long-term forms of
            cooperation,
            from
            ecology to civil interaction, seem to be a good idea. Long-term forms can also include developing better
            joint
            situational awareness that is crucial in the ambiance of perpetual military exercises. Expanding the
            exchange of
            information can help us in conflict management.</p>
        <p>In a short-term prospective, both sides should try to enhance the role of OSCE in the region as a mighty
            mediator. In
            general, the stress must be on the cooperation not only inside, but also outside the region – the main
            idea for
            today is
            to renew US security guarantees within NATO, that are under risk because of Trump’s politics. The last
            but not
            the
            least, is to increase the integration of Finland and Sweden that are key regional actors. Probably, it
            will help
            to
            achieve a triangular balance in the region – security should be cooperative as well as common.</p>
